<h3>Bot for automating routine in simple-mmo-bot</h3>

Usage Tips

If you step too fast too often, that might be a flag. If you step for too long, too often (no rests), that might be a flag.
4k steps on a single day is already hard to do legit (8 hours). Stick with something like 100-2000 steps a day.
Have rests built in your bot. Start Work. Make the bot come back in a few hours. Claim Work. Start stepping again. Repeat.
Avoid doing inhuman things. Avoid calling their API too often.
I used their profile click function for my own use (checking health/energy/etc.). A few times.
